# Q-Learning
Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm which learns the value of an action in a particular state. It can be used to teach a program to learn based on letting explore and finding the best actions to perform based on the state it is at. In this example of Q-Learning, I am using Q-Learning to teach a program to find the shortest path from point A to point B within a graph of nodes:

# Setup
Clone this repository and in order to compile the program just run:
> sudo make main.cpp utils.cpp

# Future Work
In the near future, I will use this algorithm (or an algorithm based on this algorithm) to train the computer to drive cars on a narrow road.
